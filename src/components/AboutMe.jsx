                An aspiring Software Engineer about to graduate with a
                Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I have a strong
                passion for Artificial Intelligence and Web Development, with a
                growing focus on full-stack engineering using modern frameworks
                like React, Next.js, Django, and machine learning with Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey with computers started early.I've been exploring,
                fixing, and experimenting with computers since I was five. By
                age twelve, I was already formatting my computer, removing damaged hard drives, replacing ram, and fixing various other problems from
                video game performance issues on my computer to system-level
                errors I had while trying to play video games ðŸ˜­.
              </p>
              <p>
                This hands-on curiosity laid the foundation for my
                problem-solving mindset and passion for software development.
                Though I'm just beginning my professional journey, I've built a
                solid foundation through academic projects and personal
                exploration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm always eager to collaborate on meaningful projects and
                thrive in team environments where learning and innovation are
                valued. My strengths lie in rapidly approaching problems with
                curiosity and logic, strong foundational programming skills, and
                an enthusiasm for staying up-to-date with emerging technologies.

                Currently, I'm involved in research exploring the use of large

                I also enjoy walking, going out with friends, and staying active
                outside of tech. I value meaningful connections and balance in life. These moments help
                me recharge and bring fresh perspective to the work I do. I'm
                also an avid gamer. Video games have not only been a
                source of fun but also one of the earliest sparks for my
                interest in computers. It's where my curiosity for tech first took root, and it still helps me unwind
                and stay sharp today.
